# Description

This repository contains the R script and dataset for the [PCA tutorial](https://leosotoj.com/post/2024/09/28/study-of-essential-oils-with-principal-components-analysis-in-r) with an example of studying the chemical composition of essential oils obtained from GC-MS. 

To run the script you can download it with the csv file to a local directory. Then update the working directory in the R script. A easy way to run the R script is using [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/).

The chemical composition data was adapted from the Benomari's et al. study available on [10.3390/molecules28114439](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28114439).
